## Question 4

### a The two if statements are equivalent because they both get the same end result.
The first one will only run if both files a and b exist 
The second one will also only run if both files a and b exist
They differ on how they check, the first one checks is both a and b exist at the same time while the second checks if one or the other doesn't exist.


### b
The first statement checks if the type is an int checks if it's higher than 7 at the same time and then does the same if it's a float while the second checks the type and THEN checks if it's higher. They both get the same result but differ in how they check the conditions.
